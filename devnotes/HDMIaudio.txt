It'd be nice to have sound output disabled on device in HDMI mode. 

I've put a patch in sound/arm/emxx-mixer.c 

static int codec_power_on(void)
{
   ...
	/* Mute speakers (not Headphone) in case of HDMI output */
	if (HDMI_OUTPUT_MODE == EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P) {
		res = CODEC_WRITE_M(RT5621_SPK_OUT_VOL, RT_L_MUTE | RT_R_MUTE, RT_L_MUTE | RT_R_MUTE);

But seems not working, as I can still hear audio through speakers... need to debug (though not urgent).

Enabling debug in Kernel, to see what's happening...

I ended up adding a simialr section into rt5621_AudioMute() as well.

It worked: on HDMI, internal speakers get muted now.
