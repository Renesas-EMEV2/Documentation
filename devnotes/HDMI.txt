Copied IT6610 driver to my kenel branch, from Smallart kernel:

Compilation OK.

On bootup with USB mouse pluged in and HDMI plugged to my TV, I get these in dmesg

<6>emxx_fb: registered device fb
<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret!
<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret=0!
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe!

<4>
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe: register_chrdev 0, it6610
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe: success

but video display is still on tablet LCD, not on TV.

Noticed these comments in drivers/video/emxx/emxx_lcdhw.c

 * GPIO_P27 : HDMI  Hot-Plug-Detect (HPD), input

 *                          LCD          HDMI     suspend
 * LCD DISP(104)   IN       pull up       up       up
 * LCD RST(103)    OUT       1            0        0
 * HDMI HPD(27)    IN       pull down     dn       dn

 * I remove HDMI HPD (GPIO_P27), must modify in u-boot, otherwise LCD maybe does not display
 *	set HPD gpio_input and pull down
 *

So, maybe P27 pulldown should be handled in uboot, but I guess also in kernel, to detect whether HDMI is plugged in.

But I can't find any handling of GPIO_P27, in either Smallart or Livall kernel code...

It's probably handled fully in uboot? 

With Smallar tablet, I get these from dmesg:

dmesg.GB.working:<4>===== HDMI inserted =====
dmesg.GB.working:<4>HDMI output mode, lcd backlight off.
dmesg.GB.working:<4>===== HDMI removed =====

message "===== HDMI inserted =====" is found in this fragment of code, 

 drivers/video/emxx/it6610/cat6611_sys.c

HDMITX_DevLoopProc()
{
	BYTE HPD, HPDChange ;

	CheckHDMITX(&HPD,&HPDChange) ;
	
	if( HPDChange ){
		if( HPD ){
#ifdef CONFIG_EMXX_HDMI
			printk("\n===== HDMI inserted =====\n");
			hdmi_notifier_call_chain(EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P, NULL);
#endif
 
and in turn, ChekcHDMITX is based upon a reading on I2C 

    sysstat = HDMITX_ReadI2C_Byte(REG_SYS_STATUS) ;

so, that means HDP is detected from the IT6610 chip (which has an input from HDP pin) and not from GPIO P27.

Issue is whether HDMITX_DevLoopProc is ever called in my case ...

In emxx_it6610.c probe function, irq hander seems initialized proerly, with IRQ received from GPIO_P6 as per schematics.

Not sure what's still missing....

Also need to check whether GPIO_P27 is set as input and pulled down.

At the moment, this is set in UBOOT board/emxx/emev/lowlevel_init_val.h by:

1) GPIO PIN control:

#define CHG_PINSEL_G000_VAL		0xff0bffeb

1111 1111 0000 1011 1111 1111 1110 1011

  P27 -> bit 27 = 1 (OK: select GPIO function)

2) Pulldown control:

#define CHG_PULL1_VAL			0x00000505  

where GPIO_P27 is bits 4-7 all set to 0, which is NOT OK.

Should be 0x00000555

 5 = 0111 = No Shmitt trigger + Enable Input + Pull Down + Enable Pull Up/down

(P26 and P28 are now set as pulled-down inputs)

  ... to build and test ...

Another thing I'm missing is in JB, system settings, HDMI options...

Found this code in PhoneWindowManager.java:

    void initializeHdmiState() {
        boolean plugged = false;
        // watch for HDMI plug messages if the hdmi switch exists
        if (new File("/sys/devices/virtual/switch/hdmi/state").exists()) {
            mHDMIObserver.startObserving("DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/switch/hdmi");
            ...

which is based upon kernel driver setting up an "hdmi" switch device on fs, as for example in this case:

 https://github.com/defer/semc-kernel-msm8x60/commit/547110e9d048fd0a7c34d0ad305a240a080bfe4f

We miss something like this in our kernel driver code.
