Copied IT6610 driver to my kernel branch, from Smallart kernel:

#	drivers/video/emxx/it6610/

Compilation OK.

On bootup, with USB mouse plugged in and HDMI plugged to my TV, I get these in dmesg:

<6>emxx_fb: registered device fb
<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret!
<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret=0!
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe!

<4>
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe: register_chrdev 0, it6610
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe: success

but video display is still on tablet LCD, not on TV...

Noticed these comments in drivers/video/emxx/emxx_lcdhw.c

 * GPIO_P27 : HDMI  Hot-Plug-Detect (HPD), input

 *                          LCD          HDMI     suspend
 * LCD DISP(104)   IN       pull up       up       up
 * LCD RST(103)    OUT       1            0        0
 * HDMI HPD(27)    IN       pull down     dn       dn

 * I remove HDMI HPD (GPIO_P27), must modify in u-boot, otherwise LCD maybe does not display
 *	set HPD gpio_input and pull down
 *

So, maybe P27 pulldown should be handled in uboot, but I guess also in kernel, to detect whether HDMI is plugged in.

But I can't find any handling of GPIO_P27, in either Smallart or Livall kernel code...

It's probably handled fully in uboot? 

With a Smallart tablet, I get these from dmesg:

dmesg.GB.working:<4>===== HDMI inserted =====
dmesg.GB.working:<4>HDMI output mode, lcd backlight off.
dmesg.GB.working:<4>===== HDMI removed =====

message "===== HDMI inserted =====" is found in this fragment of code, 

 drivers/video/emxx/it6610/cat6611_sys.c

HDMITX_DevLoopProc()
{
	BYTE HPD, HPDChange ;

	CheckHDMITX(&HPD,&HPDChange) ;
	
	if( HPDChange ){
		if( HPD ){
#ifdef CONFIG_EMXX_HDMI
			printk("\n===== HDMI inserted =====\n");
			hdmi_notifier_call_chain(EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P, NULL);
#endif
 
and in turn, ChekcHDMITX is based upon a reading on I2C 

    sysstat = HDMITX_ReadI2C_Byte(REG_SYS_STATUS) ;

so, that means HDP is detected from the IT6610 chip (which has an input from HDP pin) and not from GPIO P27.

Issue is whether HDMITX_DevLoopProc is ever called in my case ...

In emxx_it6610.c probe function, irq handler seems initialized properly, with IRQ received from GPIO_P6 as per schematics.

Not sure what's still missing....

 - - - -

Also need to check whether GPIO_P27 is set as input and pulled down.

At the moment, this is set in UBOOT board/emxx/emev/lowlevel_init_val.h by:

1) GPIO PIN control:

#define CHG_PINSEL_G000_VAL		0xff0bffeb

1111 1111 0000 1011 1111 1111 1110 1011

  P27 -> bit 27 = 1 (OK: select GPIO function)

2) Pulldown control:

#define CHG_PULL1_VAL			0x00000505  

where GPIO_P27 is bits 4-7 all set to 0, which is NOT OK.

Should be 0x00000555

 5 = 0111 = No Shmitt trigger + Enable Input + Pull Down + Enable Pull Up/down

(P26 and P28 are now set as pulled-down inputs)

Another thing I'm missing is HDMI options, in JB System Settings.

Found this code in PhoneWindowManager.java:

    void initializeHdmiState() {
        boolean plugged = false;
        // watch for HDMI plug messages if the hdmi switch exists
        if (new File("/sys/devices/virtual/switch/hdmi/state").exists()) {
            mHDMIObserver.startObserving("DEVPATH=/devices/virtual/switch/hdmi");
            ...

which is based upon kernel driver setting up an "hdmi" switch device on fs, as for example in this case:

 https://github.com/defer/semc-kernel-msm8x60/commit/547110e9d048fd0a7c34d0ad305a240a080bfe4f

Do we also miss something like this in our kernel driver code?

But probably that's for the "Hot-plug" of HDMI... maybe.

Looking for init of CHG_PULL1 in kernel:

$ find . -name *.c | xargs grep -w CHG_PULL1
./drivers/input/touchscreen/pixcir_i2c_ts_v2.6.c:      writel(readl(CHG_PULL1)|0xC000, CHG_PULL1);
./drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix_touch.c:	       writel(readl(CHG_PULL1)|0xC000, CHG_PULL1);
./drivers/input/touchscreen/pixcir_i2c_ts.c:	       writel(readl(CHG_PULL1)|0xC000, CHG_PULL1);
./arch/arm/mach-emxx/emev_reg_init.c:	               writel((readl(CHG_PULL1) | 0x00000005), CHG_PULL1);

So, the PIN27 pulldown control (bit 4-7: 0x------5-) is missing in kernel as well.

Adding it, like below:

        // HDMI HPD input
        // set pin 27 to gpio mode and enable input
        writel(readl(CHG_PINSEL_G000) | (0x1 << 27), CHG_PINSEL_G000);
        writel((readl(CHG_PULL1) | 0x00000050), CHG_PULL1);

... rebuild ... Need to test!

Fixing a mistake in emev_board.h, for I2C definitions, like below:

#if defined(CONFIG_EMXX_HDMI)
#if defined(CONFIG_EMXX_HDMI_ADV7523)
#define I2C_SLAVE_HDMI_NAME	"adv7523"
#define I2C_SLAVE_HDMI_ADDR	0x39
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_EMXX_HDMI_IT6610)
#define I2C_SLAVE_HDMI_NAME	"it6610"
#define I2C_SLAVE_HDMI_ADDR	0x4c
#endif
#endif

Enabling debug logs about HDMI in kernel and rebooting (no HDMI diplay attached) I get:

<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret!
<4>hdmi_it6610_init ret=0!
<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe!
<4>i2c_hdmi_init!
<4>i2c_hdmi_init =0!
<4>hdmi_it6610_reset: hdmi it6610 reset

<4>hdmi_it6610_pf_probe: success
<4>hdmi_i2c_probe!
<4>HDMIInitCAT6611:InitCAT6611():

Note how we get to the InitCAT611(), but not to the HDMITX_DevLoopProc(), where the HDP check is done.

Need to re-test with the HDMI display plugged-in on boot-up...

Starting up with HDMI display plugged-in I get an "Unsupported mode" on display (which keeps flashing some noise image) and device LCD still active.

In dmesg I get lots more debug messages (see HDMI/hdmi.out) on startup:

[...]
<4>HDMIInitCAT6611:InitCAT6611():
<4>==>>hdmi irq 0 
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:REG_SYS_STATUS = ec

<4>HDMIReadEDID:ReadEDID(): ReqCount = 32, bCurrOffset = 96
<4>HDMIReadEDID:ReadEDID(): ReqCount = 32, bCurrOffset = 128

Then, a series of messages like below follow:

<4>==>>hdmi irq 0 
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:REG_SYS_STATUS = f0HDMICheckHDMITX:INT_Handler: reg06 = 00
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:INT_Handler: reg07 = 01
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:interrupt Authenticate Fail.

<4>HDMIHDCP_Authenticate:int2 = 00 DDC_Status = 82
<4>HDMIHDCP_Authenticate:reg46 = 00 reg16 = 82
[...]


Note that having "===== HDMI inserted =====" in logs means at least this one is called:

   cat6611_sys.c -> hdmi_notifier_call_chain(EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P, NULL);

which in turns should trigger this:

   emxx_fb.c -> hdmi_output_setup()

-rw-r--r-- 1 ffxx68 ffxx68   3054 Dec  7 17:42 commit-f7b31fd

which can drive HDMI output on the HDMI dongle.

Among all (most changes seems already there...), need to investigate about these:

 commit-a380095 -> hdmi_output_setup() - which is then changed again by commit-ab53d57 
 commit-a54ec8f -> change from 50 to 60Hz mode
 commit-a76aff5 -> LCD pin drive 12 to 4mA
 commit-ab53d57 -> HDMI screen size (100%, 95%, 80%)
 commit-f78f109 & commit-f7b31fd -> LCD underrun fix ?

 - - - - - -

Applying patches one by one, manually (patch don't work).

1) commit-a54ec8f (change from 50 to 60Hz mode) first of all...

 -> HDMI not working (TV doesn't lock on display and LCD screen is kept on)

2) with commit-a76aff5 (LCD pin current drive) ...

 -> HDMI not working (as above))

 - - - - - -

3) commit-ab53d57 "HDMI output size change" 

Changes to add selection (how) of 100%, 95%, 90%, 85% in 720P HDMI mode
 
 build: OK 
 test no HDMI: OK (infact, no functional change is introduced in this case)
Just a minor issue, on boot up, before "android" logo, a random color bars are briefly shown on the black screen.

 test HDMI: not working (as above)

 - - - - - - 

 10 Dec

4) commit-213cabb "Fixed HDMI output size changes"

Most of code was removed, but later reintroduced with commit-ab53d57 (for HDMI size selection).

 build & no-HDMI test: OK
 test HDMI: ?

5) commit-5ce457b "Modified HDMI detect and audio output"

This is the upgrade from IT6610 driver version: 1.12 to 1.15.
Nothing to apply in my case, as I'm already on 1.15.

6) commit-a380095 "HDMI video dynamic switching"

Most of changes already present. 
Only change applied to hdmi_output_setup(), adding FB update (although that was removed by commit-ab53d57...).

 build & no-HDMI test: OK
 HDMI test: bootup fails!!!

-> Removed 6)

 build & no-HDMI test: OK
 HDMI test: not working (as before)

Trying to understand the reason of this error:

<4>==>>hdmi irq 0 
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:REG_SYS_STATUS = f0HDMICheckHDMITX:INT_Handler: reg06 = 00
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:INT_Handler: reg07 = 01
<4>HDMICheckHDMITX:interrupt Authenticate Fail.

Here

 http://wenku.baidu.com/view/f7cec6868762caaedd33d442.html

I find the programing guide for CAT6613 (it's not 6611, but very similar I guess).

on page 5, the return code is explaied as:

"Authentication fail event responded in reg07[0] is activated whenever HDCP authentication fail, 
include the initial authentication checking fail or any integrating check fail. Whenever this event 
occurs, the HDCP authentication should be restart. This event is enabled by reg0A[0] = ‘0’, and 
cleared by setting reg0C[2] when writing reg0E[0] with ‘1’."

Looking for explanation, that doesn't help much, as DHCP is about encryption of protected data...

Got Smallart HDMI dongle kernel:

 /media/u02/RenesasEV2/Smallart/kernel_dongle/kernel_uhost

Comparing these files in drivers/video/emxx, for my kernel wrt to that one:

 emxx_fb.c
 emxx_fb.h
 emxx_lcd.c
 emxx_lcd.h
 emxx_lcdhw.c
 emxx_lcdhw.h
 it6610/cat6611_drv.c
 it6610/cat6611_drv.h
 it6610/cat6611_sys.c
 it6610/cat6611_sys.h
 it6610/emxx_it6610.c
 it6610/emxx_it6610.c
 it6610/*

Most significant differences are in emxx_fb.c and emxx_lcdhw.c.

One critical difference (I think) in emxx_lcdhw.c, within change_output(), is:

- my kernel:
...
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_LCD:
		/* WVGA LCD */
		change_pinsel_wvga();
		break;
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_1080I:
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P:
		/* HDMI */
		change_pinsel_hdmi();
		/* No using spi for livall
		unreset_usi3();*/
		break;


- Smallart dongle, within change_output():
...
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_LCD:
		/* WVGA LCD */
		change_pinsel_wvga();
		break;
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_1080I:
	case EMXX_FB_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_720P:
		/* HDMI */
		change_pinsel_wvga();
		break;

Also, Smallart dongle does not handle the sub-100% 720P HDMI resolutions.

These, along with other differences need to be ported and tested...
