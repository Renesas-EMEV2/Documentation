With connected WiFi...

FAIL

not getting any message from log... 

This patch is interesting "bcm4329: bcmdhd: Add signal_poll command support":

 https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/broadcom/wlan/+/d7edab78ddecd5492c22006c1b1e23c6c6b2a479

but this seems to me already present in our wpa_supplicant code...

Also interesting: http://www.mail-archive.com/ath9k-devel@lists.ath9k.org/msg10158.html

------------------
As for "wpa_cli signal_poll", it get output like this:

Selected interface 'wlan0'
RSSI=-37
LINKSPEED=1
NOISE=-93
FREQUENCY=2462

If you get a fail, then maybe your distribution-provided wpa_supplicant is outdated and/or using the old WEXT interface as well. Find a way to use wpa_supplicant with -Dnl80211, and retry. 
------------------

Hence, replacing

service wpa_supplicant /system/bin/wpa_supplicant -dd -Dwext -ieth0 -c /system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf
    class main
    socket wpa_eth0 dgram 660 wifi system
    group system wifi inet
    disabled
    oneshot

with

service wpa_supplicant /system/bin/wpa_supplicant -dd -Dnl80211 -ieth0 -c /system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf
    class main
    socket wpa_eth0 dgram 660 wifi system
    group system wifi inet
    disabled
    oneshot

But it doesn't work:

E/wpa_supplicant( 1258): eth0: Unsupported driver 'nl80211'
D/wpa_supplicant( 1258): Failed to add interface eth0

After checking source code a bit, I figured out where the problem was. 
The link to the signal_poll driver function was missing, in driver_wext.c:

const struct wpa_driver_ops wpa_driver_wext_ops = {
        ...
        .signal_poll = wpa_driver_signal_poll,

Adding this solved the problem, as WiFi signal level is shown on notification bar icon!

Though it's way lower than real...

About reported signal strenght, this thread is an interesting one:

 http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=31261798#post31261798

Liu said a newer BCM driver version might have fixed that lower-than-expected signal level.

A quick hack might be the one suggested in the xda forum, to correct Android "translation" of RSSI to bar levels.
